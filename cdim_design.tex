\section{Introduction}
\label{S:introduction}
The introduction goes here.
%
Discuss the relevance to NASA, including the science objectives of the mission and how the mission satisfies a Probe class mission.
%
Describe the scope of the paper, including how the design of the spacecraft is driven by the science objectives.

\subsection{Requirements}
\label{sS:requirements}
Also explain the requirements of a spacecraft that should make these observations, including the spectral and spatial characteristics, sensitivity, and logistics (\textit{i.e.} location, lifetime).

\section{Mirror}
Recall requirements such as FoV, spectral resolution. Technical requirement of temperature.
Based on spectral resolution and FoV, need between 1m-1.5m. Based on cost estimates from Stahl, estimate target diameter, which rersults in target mass.

\section{Detector}
Recall requirements of spatial resolution, wavelength range, and sensitivity. Technical requirement of temperature. Explain detector type and pixel size that fulfils these.

Multiple detectors are satisfactory, range in TRL, but all are pretty far in development and have been demonstrated in NEOCam, SPHEREx, and JWST.

Using H2RG, need this many which results in this power draw.

\section{Thermal Regulation}
General approach to cooling with passive and active. Explain tradeoffs between passive and active.

\subsection{Passive Cooling}
Explain generally how v-groove radiators work. Used on planck and jwst. Desired final temp based on material, setup and location.
