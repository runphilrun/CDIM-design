\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}
% Discuss the relevance to NASA, including the science objectives of the mission and how the mission satisfies a Probe-class mission.

% Observing the behavior and characteristics of the earliest stars and galaxies is fundamental to understanding the physics that led to their formation and evolution.
% Breakthrough discoveries in understanding the physics of the epoch of reionization are anticipated in the 2020--2030 decade thanks to the Wide Field Infrared Survey Telescope (WFIRST)~\cite{wfirstFinal2012} and James Webb Space Telescope (JWST)~\cite{Gardner2006}.
% However, JWST's capability will be limited to several \SI{10}{arcmin\squared} cosmological deep fields, and although WFIRST will be capable of \SI{3400}{deg\squared} wide area surveys, its spectroscopy is limited to \SI{2}{\micro\meter}, limiting the selection of galaxies it is able to observe.
% Neither JWST nor WFIRST provide a complete understanding of the epoch of reionization, specifically in terms of answering the questions of when and how the universe came to be.
% This area of research is a prime candidate for a Probe-class mission optimized to study reionization.

% CDIM fills a gap in the 2020 Decadal between two other not so famous telescopes in the 2030 range after JWST and WFIRST and Hubble

The Cosmic Dawn Intensity Mapper (CDIM) is a concept for a Probe-class \SI{1.5}{\meter} aperture telescope, passively cooled to \SI{45}{\kelvin}, with an actively cooled $6\times6$ detector array that utilizes linear variable filters (LVFs)~\cite{cooray2016cdim2page} capable of three-dimensional spectro-imaging observations over the wavelength range of 0.75 to \SI{7.5}{\micro\meter} at a spectral resolving power R$=500$.
CDIM has a \SI{10}{\deg\squared} instantaneous field of view (FoV) atop a focal plane of thirty-six $2048\times2048$ detectors.
The survey strategy using spacecraft operations following a shift and stare mode will result in 1360 independent narrow-band spectral images of the sky on a given location.
Surveys are planned to span from \SI{25}{\deg\squared} up to \SI{1000}{\deg\squared} over a five year lifetime in an orbit about Sun-Earth Lagrange point L$_{2}$\@.

Although Wide Field Infrared Survey Telescope (WFIRST) will be capable of \SI{3400}{deg\squared} wide area surveys, its spectroscopy is limited to \SI{2}{\micro\meter}, limiting the selection of galaxies it is able to observe~\cite{wfirstFinal2012}.
While James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) is capable of targeted spectroscopy studies of galaxies present in reionization and surveys \SI{10}{armin\squared} for reionization galaxies~\cite{Gardner2006}, CDIM will make use of tomographic intensity mapping of spectral emission lines to study the aggregate statistical properties of the sources and their spatial distribution.
The intensity of the Ly$\alpha$ and H$\alpha$ lines, combined with others, will also provide critical clues to the formation of metals in the universe~\cite{cooray2016cdim2page}.

% What is a "Probe-class" mission?
Probe-class missions occupy a role on a larger scale than Discovery missions, such as Kepler and Dawn, but not as large as Flagship missions such as JWST.\@
Such missions are intended to be PI-led scientific investigations rather than general observatories, and have a firm \$1B cap~\cite{probeclasswp}.
Critical design requirements to achieve CDIM's science goals as a Probe-class mission are summarized in~\autoref{tab:critical-params}.
CDIM will leverage mature and flight-proven technology to reduce development costs.
% CDIM is optimized to search for the first cosmic sources of dust and evidence of the very earliest stellar populations, bridging the gaps in the JWST and WFIRST cosmic dawn surveys and exceeding them in capability.

\section{Optical Telescope Assembly}
\label{sec:ota}
% \label{sec:mirror}
% Recall requirements such as FoV, spectral resolution. Technical requirement of temperature.
Preliminary explorations indicate that a $1.3$--$1.5$\si{\meter} aperture off-axis primary mirror cooled to \SI{45}{\kelvin} is required to meet CDIM's spectro-imaging  requirements~\cite{cooray2016cdim2page}.
The primary mirror is notionally assumed to be constructed from light-weighted Corning (ultra-low expansion) silica-titania glass with a honeycomb core and a gold-deposition surface coating.
For this type of mirror, the estimated mass is in the neighborhood of \SI{200}{\kilo\gram}.

% \subsection{Detectors}
% \label{subSec:detector}
For near-IR observations, the primary mirror must be cooled to cryogenic temperatures.
Rather than including a heating element and detectors that operate at warm temperatures, it is advantageous to use detectors that operate at cryogenic temperatures as well so as to minimize thermal radiation that could be detrimental to near-infrared (near-IR) observations.

A $6\times6$ array of $2048\times2048$ pixel detectors is required cover a \SI{10}{deg\squared} focal plane with \SI{1}{arcsec} pixels.
HgCdTe infrared detectors meet CDIM design goals of operating at cryogenic temperatures, low in cost, and, of course, sensitive in near-IR.\@
Several types of HgCdTe detectors satisfy CDIM's spatial resolution, wavelength range, and sensitivity requirements.
These detectors range in technology-readiness-level (TRL), but all are sufficiently developed to be considered for the 2020~Decadal and will be demonstrated on missions such as NEOCam, SPHEREx, and JWST~\cite{dore4872spherex,Gardner2006}.
Candidate detectors are listed in~\autoref{tab:detectors}.

\begin{table}[!ht]
  \centering
  \caption{Candidate Teledyne $2048\times2048$ pixel detectors for the CDIM FPA~\red{cite cdim proposal}.

  \begin{tabular}{@{}lccc@{}} \toprule
            & TRL & Wavelength Range          & Heritage \\ \midrule

    H2RG-2.5& 8   & 0.9--2.5\si{\micro\meter} & $1024\times1024$ (TRL 9) \\
    H2RG-5.0& 8   & 2.5--5.0\si{\micro\meter} & $1024\times1024$ (TRL 9) \\
    H2RG-8.0& 4   & 5.0--10.0\si{\micro\meter} & $1024\times1024$ (TRL 6) \\ \bottomrule
  \end{tabular}
\end{table}

CDIM will utilize 36 detectors in a close-packed, $6\times6$ mosaic focal plane assembly (FPA).
In the expected normal operating mode, each detector dissipates less than \SI{4}{\milli\watt}, for a total power dissipation of less than \SI{150}{\milli\watt} for the full array.

Linear-variable filters (LVFs) will be placed just above the detectors to provide spectral dispersion for spectrometry.
LVFs are simple, space-qualified solutions to permit spectral data cubes between $0.75$--$7.5$\si{\micro\meter} that are commercially available and significantly lower in cost than more complex systems~\cite{photonicsdotcom2016lvf}.

CDIM optics, instruments, and focal plane will be housed in an aluminum light-tight box that is be bead blasted to a matte finish and black anodized.
The purpose of this housing is to reduce reflections and scattered light from the exposed, reflective portions of the detectors.

The optical telescope assembly (OTA) as a whole is estimated to have a mass of 200--250\si{\kilo\gram}.

\section{Thermal Design}
\label{sec:thermal}
% General approach to cooling with passive and active. Explain tradeoffs between passive and active.
CDIM will employ both passive and active thermal regulation systems.
By using passive radiators in tandem with an active cryocooler, the static OTA heat load can be dissipated by the lightweight radiator and a smaller cryocooler may be used to only cool the detector array rather than the whole OTA mass plus FPA.\@
Passive cooling is used to cool the OTA and FPA from solar radiation, while active cooling regulates heat dissipated by active detectors.

The OTA is cooled to \SI{45}{\kelvin} to reduce background photon load in the near-IR.\@
Passive thermal regulation is maintained using a multi-stage V-groove radiator, which bounces radiative heat into the \SI{3}{\kelvin} background of space~\cite{bard_1987}.

\begin{figure}[!hb]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=.5\linewidth]{figs/vgroove-concept.png}
  \caption{Low emmissivity, high specular surface vanes are nested at a slight angle to reflect thermal radiation into space~\cite{rasbach1988}. \red{Replace this figure with a powerpoint graphic.}}
\label{fig:v-groove}
\end{figure}

V-groove radiators have been demonstrated in passive cryogenic radiators up to \SI{4}{\kelvin} with Planck, SPIRIT, and Spitzer (warm mission).\@
Like Planck, the active coolers are also pre-cooled to less than \SI{50}{\kelvin} this way~\cite{shinozaki2014spica}.
In order to achieve passive cooling from a baseline temperature of \SI{300}{\kelvin} at Sun-Earth Lagrange point \Ltwo, CDIM will feature a \red{\SI{0}{\meter\squared} $x$-stage} V-groove radiator.
\red{Since CDIM may be at various angles of incidence to solar radiation as it surveys the sky, the V-groove radiator fins will extend outward, more like SPHEREx than Planck}.

CDIM's thermal requirement to reduce thermal noise in the detector array can be met by actively cooling the array to \SI{35}{\kelvin} by a mechanical cryocooler.
Stirling-cycle mechanical refrigerators are low-vibration, high-reliability, and lightweight active cryocooling systems that have significant heritage in space applications.
Pulse-tube mechanical cryocoolers are similar to Stirling cryocoolers in capacity, cost, and function.
While Stirling cryocoolers use mechanisms to drive the thermodynamic cycle, Pulse-tube cryocoolers use an acoustic standing wave.
Either type of cryocooler is suitible for CDIM, and both types have significant heritage in space applications~\cite{gilmore2003spacecraft}.
One candidate system is Raytheon's PSC 1-stage Stirling cryocooler, capable of cooling a \SI{1.2}{\watt} parasitic heat load to \SI{35}{\kelvin}.
This cryocooler is \SI{18.6}{\kilo\gram} and requires \SI{88}{\watt} of input power~\cite{ross2005cryocoolers}.

In this configuration, the most significant heat loads from the cooled section come from conduction through the OTA support structure, which isolates the cooled section from the warm spacecraft bus.
Only the mirror and detectors need to be cooled to cryogenic temperatures.
Electronics boards that control the FPA and instrumentation need not be cryocooled.
These warm electronics are housed in CDIM's spacecraft bus with other spacecraft systems.
Some components that require cooling below the temperature of the bus, but not so far as the FPA, may be placed between stages of the V-groove radiator.
A notional map of heat transfer is shown in~\autoref{fig:heat-map}.

\begin{figure}[!ht]

\section{Attitude Determination and Control}
\label{sec:adcs}
CDIM will be three-axis stabilized using an inertial reference unit and star-trackers.
Star trackers identify constellations in their field of view to determine the spacecraft's heading to within 1--3 arcseconds.
These systems are used to coarsely slew CDIM to a target.

Rather than using more accurate (and more expensive) inertial or star-tracking sensors, fine pointing guidance sensors may be included on the focal plane, as demonstrated by WFIRST~\cite{wfirstFinal2012}.
These fine guidance sensors enable CDIM to meet its relative pointing control requiremend of \SI{2.5}{arcsec}.
% Recall attitude control requirements for science objectives.
% To conduct a survey, the spacecraft must first understand its orientation and then act to align itself with a given area of the sky.
Redundant systems are included to allow CDIM to operate in different power states.
Low-fidelity attitude determination sensors such as sun sensors are cheap, accurate to less than one degree, and lightweight.
Sun sensors provide CDIM with a coarse safe-hold capability.
% Explain the star tracker among other attitude control systems. Select a class of star tracker.

% Briefly explain inertial and propulsive attitude control and the limitations of each.
In a heliocentric orbit, the primary disturbance to the spacecraft's heading is solar radiation pressure (SRP).
Solar radiation pressure imparts a near-constant \SI{4.5e-10}{\newton\per\meter\squared} to spacecraft orbiting \Ltwo~\cite{evans2002natural}.

Hydrazine monopropellant thrusters will be used for orbit station-keeping as well as momentum management.
A desired heading is maintained by the spacecraft using a 3-axis zero-momentum inertial system, whereby the error in heading due to SRP is cancelled out by spinning up or slowing down reaction wheels.
Reaction wheel systems are capable of torques ranging from $.01$ to $1$\si{\newton\meter} and store $0.4$ to $3000$\si{\newton\meter\second} of practical momentum~\cite{smad2015}.
Power consumption varies with reaction wheel speed, with a maximum estimate of roughly \SI{100}{\watt}.
After some time the inertial attitude control may become saturated.
Desaturation is managed by engaging station-keeping thrusters for short periods of time.
Additionally, these thrusters will be used to maintain an orbit at \Ltwo{} as it is an inherently unstable orbit.

\section{Flight Computer}
% CDIM is capable of autonomous operation and system diagnostics.
CDIM will be capable of autonomous operation and system diagnostics.
Nominal operation includes maintaining a heading during imaging, slewing across the sky to conduct a survey, capturing images, and downlinking data to Earth.
Images will be processed on-board CDIM using an algorithm demonstrated by SPHEREx~\cite{spherexTelemetry2016}.

\section{Telemetry}
\label{sec:telemetry}
Typically for high-Earth and deep-space missions, the X-Band Space Science frequency band is used for uplink and downlink between the spacecraft and Ground Stations.
Thus, high-gain antennas are best suited for both links~\cite{smad2015}.

The data rate and data volume generated by a CDIM survey is estimated by scaling the known performance of SPHEREx.
A survey conducted by SPHEREx using four $2048\times2048$ H2RG detectors generates araw data volume, $D$, of \SI{168.39}{Gbit/day}, and uses on-board processing that compresses the data at a compression ratio of $2.5$:$1$ before downlinking, resulting in a final data volume, $D_c$ of \SI{63.7}{Gb/day}~\cite{spherexTelemetry2016}.

CDIM will use 36 $2048\times2048$ detectors and a similar compression algorithm to SPHEREx.
The data volume for CDIM is estimated to be:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:telemetry-d}
  \begin{split}
    D &= \frac{36}{4} (\SI{168.39}{Gbit/day}) \\
    &= \SI{1515.51}{Gb/day}
  \end{split}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation} \label{eq:telemetry-dc}
  \begin{split}
    D_c &= \frac{1}{2.5}(\SI{1515.51}{Gb/day}) \\
    &= \SI{606.2}{Gb/day} \\
    &= \SI{7.0}{Mb/s}
  \end{split}
\end{equation}

Transmission rates are dependent on the total time available for CDIM to send data to a ground station.
For example, the spacecraft could transmit continuously at a very low transfer rate, or send larger volumes of data once per day over 1 hour at the expense of a higher transfer rate.
\begin{equation}\label{eq:telemetry-1hr}
  \begin{split}
    D_c &= \SI{606.2}{Gb/hr}  \\
     &= (\SI{606.2}{Gb/hr})(\frac{\SI{1}{hr}}{\SI{3600}{s}}) = \SI{0.1684}{Gb/s} \\
     &= \SI{168.4}{Mb/s}
  \end{split}
\end{equation}
For redundancy, CDIM is outfitted with multiple communication modes outline in~\autoref{tab:telemetry}.

\begin{wstable}[htb]
  \caption{Downlink transfer rates reflect estitmates based on the target of \SI{606.2}{Gb/day}.
  Typical data transfer rates are outlined for uplinks~\cite{smad2015}.
\label{tab:telemetry}}
  \begin{tabular}{@{}lll@{}} \toprule
    Mode & Uplink & Downlink \\ \midrule
    Emergency & \SI{7.8}{bps} & $5$--$10$\si{bps} \\
    Engineering data & $15.6$--$2000$\si{kbps} & Up to \SI{10}{bps} \\
    Science data & $15.6$--$2000$\si{kbps} & \SI{7.0}{Mbps} (continuous) or \\
    & & \SI{168.4}{Mbps} (1 hour per day)\\\bottomrule
  \end{tabular}
\end{wstable}

Uplinks will follow standard protocols and do not require transmitting large volumes or particularly fast transfer rates.
The CDIM telemetry system, including antenna and power converter, are estimated to have a mass of \SI{2}{kg}.

\section{Power}
\label{sec:power}
Since CDIM will be located at \Ltwo, it is exposed to 1291--1421\si{\watt\per\meter\squared} solar flux~\cite{evans2002natural}, accounting for Earth's eccentricity and solar flares.
All power generation will come from anarray of triple junction Arsenide (GaAs) photovoltaic cells facing the sun.
Triple junction GaAs cells are more costly than silicon cells, but are more efficient.
An array GaAs cells is more resilient to radiation and will experience less degradation over time compared to silicon cells, which is desirable for CDIM's \SI{5}{year} mission lifetime.
% While the array may be fixed, the required area of the array is minimized if the cells are able to adjust to account for different incident angles to the sun.
% The array will deploy after the launch and orbital insertion phases of the mission.

As CDIM surveys the sky, its angle of incidence to the Sun changes.
To maintain sufficient power over the full viewing range, a fixed array must be mounted at an angle, $\theta$, with respect to CDIM's viewing axis.
In this configuration, the angle of the array may be optimized such that the power efficiency is maximized in the regions that are most critical for CDIM's science objectives.
\autoref{fig:solar-array} illustrates this concept for an array incident angle of \SI{30}{\degree}.
Alternatively, CDIM could use arrays that are capable of adjusting their angle of incidence to maintain maximum efficiency.

\begin{figure}[hb]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=.6\linewidth]{figs/solar-array-config.png}
  \caption{Angle of incidence to the Sun of a fixed solar array set at \SI{30}{\degree} from the OTA viewing axis.}
\label{fig:solar-array}
\end{figure}

Solar cell efficiency degrades over time from use and radiation.
The end-of-life efficieny, $\eta_{EOL}$ is found with respect to mission duration, $L$, and estimated efficiency degradation, $D$~\cite{smad2015}.
For triple junction GaAs cells, $D$ is assumed to be 3\% per year.

\begin{equation}
  \eta_{EOL} = {(1-D)}^L
\end{equation}

\begin{table}[!ht]
  \centering
  \caption{Typical efficiencies and margins for a triple junction Gallium Arsenide solar array~\cite{smad2015}.
\label{tab:solar-array}
  }
  \begin{tabular}{@{}llrlr@{}}\toprule
    Efficiencies &&  & Margins & & \\ \cmidrule(r){1-3} \cmidrule(l){4-6}
    Ideal Conversion Efficiency & $\eta_{i}$ & 33.8\% & New Design & $m_d$ & 5\%  \\
    Production Unit Efficiency (with respect to ideal) & $\eta_{p}$  & 72.0\% & Reserves & $m_r$ & 20\% \\
    Incident Angle (\SI{30}{\degree}) & $\eta_{\theta}$ & 86.6\% & Harness Losses & $m_h$ &5\% \\
    End of Life (\SI{5}{year} mission) & $\eta_{EOL}$ & 85.9\% & Power Regulation Losses &  $m_p$ & 20\% \\ \bottomrule
  \end{tabular}
\end{table}

To be conservative, the solar flux at \Ltwo, $P_{sol}$, is estimated to be \SI{1291}{\watt\per\meter\squared}~\cite{evans2002natural}.
A similarly conservative estimate of \SI{1200}{\watt} is the assumed power draw from all CDIM instruments and components, $P_{sc}$.
CDIM power draw is estimated from the known power draw for WFIRST, as it is a fairly similar spacecraft to CDIM~\cite{wfirstFinal2012}.
A summary of margins and efficiencies is listed in~\autoref{tab:solar-array}.

The total power the array must supply to the spacecraft is found by summing all power margins:
\begin{equation}
  \begin{align}
    M &= m_d + m_r + m_h + m_p = .05 +.2 + .05 + .2 \\
    P_{sa} &= \frac{P_{sc}}{M} = \frac{\SI{1200}{\watt}}{0.50} = \SI{2400}{\watt}
  \end{align}
\end{equation}

The required solar array area, $A_{sa}$ is determined from the estimated end-of-life power capacity of the array per unit area, $P_{EOL}$.

\begin{align}\label{eq:array-area}
  &P_{o} = P_{sol}\eta_i = (\SI{1291}{\watt\per\meter\squared})(.338) = \SI{436.4}{\watt\per\meter\squared} \\
  &P_{BOL} = P_o\eta_p\eta_{\theta} = (\SI{436.4}{\watt\per\meter\squared})(.72)(.866) = \SI{272.1}{\watt\per\meter\squared} \\
  &P_{EOL} = P_{BOL}\eta_{EOL} = (\SI{272.1}{\watt\per\meter\squared})(.859) = \SI{233.6}{\watt\per\meter\squared} \\
  &A_{sa} = \frac{P_{sa}}{P_{EOL}} = \frac{\SI{2400}{\watt}}{\SI{233.6}{\watt\per\meter\squared}} = \SI{10.27}{\meter\squared}
\end{align}

The solar array size estimate derived from~\ref{eq:array-area} is very conservative.
The accuracy of the array size would be much improved if a more accurate estimate of power draw was known.

\section{Structure}
\label{sec:structure}
The mirror and detectors will be supported by low-moisture composites to provide adequate structure stiffness while minimizing mass and conductive heat loads to the cooled section.

The spacecraft bus will be a graphite epoxy composite hexagonal structure, which houses all non-instrumentation systems including the cryocooler, ADCS, telemetry, processing, power modules, and propulsion tank.
The bus will also provide hard points for integration with the launch vehicle.

\begin{figure}[htp]

\label{fig:cdim-annotated}
\end{figure}

\section{Orbit}
\label{sec:orbit}
CDIM will orbit around Sun-Earth Lagrange point \Ltwo{} since it allows the spacecraft to be oriented such that half of the celestial sphere is visible at all times, and the spacecraft may oppose the Sun, Earth, and Moon concurrently and at all times.
This also leads to a very thermally stable environment.
\Ltwo{} is near enough to Earth (roughly 1.5 million \si{\kilo\meter}) so that CDIM may communicate with ground stations without the Deep Space Network, and maintains near-constant communications geometry~\cite{canalias2004}.

\begin{figure}[!ht]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=.6\linewidth]{figs/orbits.png}
  \caption{
      \emph{Left:} Orthographic view of a quasi-periodic Lissajous orbit.
      \emph{Right:} Orthographic view of a periodic halo orbit.~\cite{gordon1993orbit}
\label{fig:orbits}
  }
\end{figure}

Around \Ltwo, two types of orbit are considered: Lissajous and halo-type orbits.
Lissajous orbits are quasi-periodic but may be smaller in radius than periodic halo orbits.
Halo orbits are more costly to achieve in terms of delta-v, or energy to transfer into such trajectory.
Station-keeping costs are not significantly different between the two orbits~\cite{gordon1993orbit}.
As such, CDIM may enter a Lissajous orbit around \Ltwo{} similar to the orbits of JWST and Herschel missions.

\section{Launch Vehicle}
\label{sec:launch}
CDIM will be comfortably within the mass and spatial limits of both currently available and development launch vehicles capable of delivering payloads to Sun-Earth Lagrange Point \Ltwo.
Future launch vehicles will be more than capable of delivering CDIM to \Ltwo, and industry trends indicate that heavy and super-heavy vehicles will continue to come online by the time CDIM launches.

Due to the rigorous launch environment, deployable structures remain stowed until CDIM is delivered to a transfer orbit en route to \Ltwo.

\section{Cost Estimation}
\label{sec:cost}
The overall cost of a space telescope may be broken down on the subsystem level.
All conclusions based on statistical analysis are only as good as their databases.
Fiscal data, such as what is required for proper analysis, is scarce.
Estimations are made with engineering judgement based on available data.

To estimate the cost of the CDIM mission, costs are separated into drivers of the \emph{mission cost}, which includes hardware, development, ground support, integration, testing, science, and management.
Existing generalized parametric cost estimation approaches identify key cost drivers for mission cost~\cite{stahl2013,bely2011}, but do not take labor or overhead costs into account.
Overhead and labor costs are included in a more robust model for \emph{total cost}, where:

\begin{equation}
  	\text{Total Cost}=(1.5)\times\text{Mission Cost}
\label{eq:total-cost}
\end{equation}

\citeauthor{stahl2013} present an approach to estimating OTA cost based on correlations with data on flown space telescope missions.
CDIM's projected costs may be obtained from these findings with engineering judgement, knowing that the data is drawn from a relatively small sample set.
Thus, an OTA aperture diameter of \SI{1.5}{\meter} yields a median OTA cost of \$58.2M.
Since OTA cost is found, estimates for other cost drivers may be obtained from relative cost values.

% The most robust model for the CDIM mission predicts its total cost to be \$684.7M, and even the more conservative model predicts CDIM costing to fall under \$800M.
The CDIM mission has significant margin under the \$1B cap for Probe-class missions.
